# legomario
This project now has two goals
* Generate printable SVG scanner codes for LEGO Mario. [Code](mariocodes.html)
* Provide a complete Python library for interacting with LEGO Mario.

    _This goal has been added due to the unfortunate desire to understand and integrate the bluetooth-encoded scanner code information that balooned into the desire to create the most complete and correct LEGO Mario communication library._
